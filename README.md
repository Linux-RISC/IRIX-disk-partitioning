Read chapter 1 on the first link to understand basic concepts:<br>

Let's begin with an empty disk with SCSI address 1, what contains its volume header?:
```
prtvtoc /dev/dsk/dks0d1vol
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

The disk doesn't have volume header, can we edit it?
```
dvhtool /dev/rdsk/dks0d1vh
dvhtool: can't open volume header /dev/rdsk/dks0d1vh
Volume? (/dev/rdsk/dks0d1vh)
```
Note: disk devices are on /dev/rdsk, list then running:
```
ls -l /dev/rdsk/*
```

In fact, the disk is empty. Let's partition it:
```
fx -x
fx version 6.5, Oct  6, 2003
fx: "device-name" = (dksc)
fx: ctlr# = (0)
fx: drive# = (1)
fx: lun# = (0)
...opening dksc(0,1,0)
...drive selftest...OK

```

It doesn't contain partitions:
```

[u]srrootdrive        [re]size
```

#### Partition templates
1. [ro]otdrive. This schema contains:
- partition 0 (root), boot partition containing all files
- partition 1 for swap
- partition 8 for volume header. It's an "odd" partition containing several files and the partition schema, device parameters and some programs (check https://techpubs.jurassic.nl/manuals/0650/admin/IA_DiskFiles/sgi_html/ch01.html#LE18926-PARENT)
- partition 10 that represents the whole disk
```
fx/repartition> ro

fx/repartition/rootdrive: type of data partition = (xfs)
Warning: you will need to re-install all software and restore user data
from backups after changing the partition layout.  Changing partitions
will cause all data on the drive to be lost.  Be sure you have the drive
backed up if it contains any user data.  Continue? yes

[ro]otdrive           [o]ptiondrive         [e]xpert
[u]srrootdrive        [re]size
```

2. [u]srrootdrive. This schema contains the same partitions than [ro]otdrive and:
- partition 6 (usr), to separate filesystems root and usr
```
fx/repartition> u

fx/repartition/usrrootdrive: type of data partition = (xfs)

----- partitions-----

[u]srrootdrive        [re]size
fx/repartition>
```

3. [o]ptiondrive.
- partition 7 for general data store, useful for example when we have a secondary disk for data
```
fx/repartition> o 

fx/repartition/optiondrive: type of data partition = (xfs)

----- partitions-----
part  type        blocks            Megabytes   (base+size)
  7: xfs        4096 + 17769428       2 + 8676
  8: volhdr        0 + 4096           0 + 2   
 10: volume        0 + 17773524       0 + 8678

capacity is 17773524 blocks

----- please choose one (? for help, .. to quit this menu)-----
[ro]otdrive           [o]ptiondrive         [e]xpert
[u]srrootdrive        [re]size
fx/repartition>
```

Now let's make the partitioning more complicated. What about a root partition and another one for data? For example with big disks using EFS, where the maximum partition is 8 GB, we could have:
- one root EFS partition of 8 GB and another one of type 7 EFS of 8 GB
- one root EFS partition of 2 GB and another one of type 7 XFS containing the rest of the disk capacity

As practical example, let's partition a disk using two XFS partitions:

1. We start from a [ro]otdrive configuration:
```
fx/repartition> ro

fx/repartition/rootdrive: type of data partition = (xfs)

----- partitions-----
part  type        blocks            Megabytes   (base+size)
  0: xfs      266240 + 17507284     130 + 8548
  1: raw        4096 + 262144         2 + 128 
  8: volhdr        0 + 4096           0 + 2   
 10: volume        0 + 17773524       0 + 8678

capacity is 17773524 blocks

----- please choose one (? for help, .. to quit this menu)-----
[ro]otdrive           [o]ptiondrive         [e]xpert
[u]srrootdrive        [re]size
fx/repartition>
```

2. Let's watch the column "Megabytes (base+size)":
- partition 8 takes from MB 0 to MB 1 (2 MB in total)
- partition 1 takes from MB 2 to MB 129 (128 MB in total)
- partition 0 takes from MB 130 to MB 8677 (8548 MB in total)
